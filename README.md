### Hi, I'm Henry ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer in the [Brain Development and Disorders lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/richardslab/) at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis Department of Neuroscience ðŸ§ !

- ðŸ”­ &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently working on ways to improve the technical possibilities of online behavioural and cognitive tasks using modern development tools while putting accessibility first.
- ðŸŒ± &nbsp; While my background was in Software Engineering, I'm learning computational neuroscience in my spare time, and I hope to do a PhD in the field.
- ðŸ‘¯ &nbsp; Iâ€™m looking to collaborate to improve existing online tools or create new tools that will further the capabilities of online behavioural and cognitive tasks while promoting accessibility.
- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp; Ask me about running online and offline behavioural and cognitive tasks!
